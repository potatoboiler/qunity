Deliverables:
- parser + grammar (can adapt Coq syntax, see references/) (note "information effects"/classical sublanguage paper in readings file)
- AST/IR just before the quantum circuit (see section 6 of qunity preprint)
- quantum Circuit I (see section 6 of qunity preprint)
- compiling IR into circuit (hopefully this part is easy?)
- write some sample code (say, QFT or Deutsch or Fourier Sampling or a basic "library", anything works)

Initial plan for April 7:
- Laurence can write this probably
